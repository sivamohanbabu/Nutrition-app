- A Google Gemini Pro Vision API key.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shihabcodes/NutriGenie.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd NutriGenie
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash

        ```

5. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Obtain a Google Gemini Pro Vision API key and set it in a `.env` file in the project directory:

    ```plaintext
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
    ```

## Running the Application

To run NutriGenie, execute the following command in your terminal within the project directory:

```bash
streamlit run app.py

```
